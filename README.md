# Using Elm in React — from the ground up

Companion repository to the article [Using Elm in React — from the ground up](https://medium.com/@cuddlyburger/using-elm-in-react-from-the-ground-up-e3866bb0369d) on Medium.

The article contains step by step instructions to create a React app (with create-react-app) and add an Elm component to it (with react-elm-components), including the necessary Webpack configuration.

There are many articles about why to introduce Elm in to a React project, and some about the various technicalities involved, but none that describe basic step by step instructions. The article aims to address this gap, and leave you with a platform to try out more complicated things.

Unfortunately the React component to interop with Elm doesn't work with React 16 yet (evancz/react-elm-components#18). However the component is very simple, and you can just bring the code directly in to your projects. More details at https://blog.boon.gl/2017/11/28/react-elm-wrapper.html.
